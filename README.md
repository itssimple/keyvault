# KeyVault - _Yet another key storage service_

![Build status: master branch](https://github.com/itssimple/keyvault/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

I'm reviving the old idea that a coworker and me had back in 2012.

Basically, I'm going to provide a simple REST API (possible that I add a GUI later) to store/fetch your secrets in a simple way.

Will also provide a client for fetching/storing in form of a nuget-package and maybe a npm-package.

I will fill this readme out a bit later, when I have gotten somewhere with the project.
